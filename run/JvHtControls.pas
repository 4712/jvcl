description : Ht Controls

Known Issues:
Maciej Kaczkowski:
  [X] alignment not work correctly on JvHTButtonGlyph
  [X] not tested on BCB & Kylix
  [X] hyperlink work only whet alignment is left

Some information about coding:
  [?] If you want use few times function <ALIGN> you must use before next <ALIGN> function <BR>

Changes:
========
André Snepvangers:
  2004-01-06
      VisualCLX compatible version
Maciej Kaczkowski:
  2003-09-16
  [+] <BR> - new line
  [+] <HR> - horizontal line
  [+] <S> and </S> - StrikeOut
  [+] Multiline for JvHTListBox, JvHTComboBox, TJvHTButton
  [+] You can change Height of JvHTComboBox
  [+] Tags: &amp; &quot; &reg; &copy; &trade; &nbsp; &lt; &gt;
  [+] <ALIGN [CENTER, LEFT, Right]>
  [*] <C:color> was changed to ex.: <FONT COLOR="clRed" BGCOLOR="clWhite">
      </FONT>
  [*] procedure ItemHTDrawEx - rewrited
  [*] function ItemHTPlain - optimized

  2003-09-23
  [*] fixed problem with <hr><br> - just use <hr>
  [-] fixed problem with inserting htcombobox on form
  [-] variable height is not work in design time, to use this put in code ex.:
      htcombobox1.SetHeight(40)
    to read height
      Value := htcombobox1.GetItemHeight;
  [-] Removed (var PlainItem: string) from header ItemHTDrawEx;
  [-] Alignment from TJvHTLabel was removed
  [+] SelectedColor, SelectedTextColor from JvMultilineListBox was moved to
      JvHTListBox and JvHTComboBox as ColorHighlight and ColorHighlightText

  2003-09-27
  [-] fixed problem transparent color on JvHTlabel
  [-] fixed problem with layout on JvHTlabel
  [*] when TJvHTlabel is not enabled has pseudo 3D color
  [+] ColorDisabledText (JvHTcombobox, JvHTlistbox) was moved from
      jvmultilinelistbox
  [-] fixed vertical scroll on JvHTlistbox
  [-] minor bugs fixed

  2003-10-04
  [-] JVCL 3.0 compatibility

  2003-10-09
  [-] Removed +1 pixel from each line (place for <hr>) to save compatibility
      with other labels
  [*] reorganized <ALIGN> function
  [+] Added tag &euro; (non-standard but useful)
  [+] Added <A HREF="%s"> </A> for hyper link where %s is linkname
      but work only when alignment is left
  [+] Added to TJvHTLabel: OnHyperLinkClick(Sender; LinkText)
  [+] Added <IND="%d"> where %d is indention from left

  2003-10-11
  [*] fixed <A HREF> with alignment but work only when autosize=true
  [*] fixed probem with autosize when alignment not left
  [+] Added <A HREF> to JvHTListBox but the same problem with hyperlinks
      when alignement is not left (need to rebuild the ItemHTDrawEx draw
      function)

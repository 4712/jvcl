Changelog for JVCL 3.0
======================
2003-06-17:
- Changed folder structure:
  * Each Delphi/BCB package collection has it's own subfolder in \packages
  * Sources split into a \design folder and a \run folder. Some items are probably incorrectly located at the moment, but this will change as I build the packages
  * All resources (.res and .dcr) are now located in \resources folder
  * All INC and common files are now located in \common
2003-06-15:

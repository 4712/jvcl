  The Provider property is used to link a <LINK TJvCustomDataProvider, data provider> to the
  control.

  The Provider property refers to a <LINK TJvDataConsumer, consumer service> which provides methods
  and properties to select a provider and optionally a context. In addition it will support a number
  of consumer service extentions as determined by the both the provider as well as the attributes
  used when the consumer service was created (which happened internally for the control).

  To be able to set other properties and/or invoke methods of these consumer service extensions, one
  should query the consumer service (this Provider property) for the interface needed:
  <CODE>
  <AUTOLINK OFF>
  <B>if</B> Supports(Provider <B>as</B> IJvDataConsumer, <I><interface GUID or type></I>, <I><variable></I>) <B>then</B>
  <B>begin</B>
    ...
  <B>end</B>;
  <AUTOLINK ON>
  </CODE>
  or:
  <CODE>
  <AUTOLINK OFF>
  <B>if</B> Provider.GetInterface(<I><interface GUID or type></I>, <I><variable></I>) <B>then</B>
  <B>begin</B>
    ...
  <B>end</B>;
  <AUTOLINK ON>
  </CODE>
  You should first declare a variable of the type of interface you will request. Within the
  begin/end block you can then use that variable which will contain a reference to the interface
  requested.

Description
  TJvCaesarCipher is a component to (de)cipher strings or series of bytes using
  "Ceasar Cipher", one of the simplest forms of substitution cipher. The method
  is named after Julius Ceasar who - as is said - used this method to communicate
  with his army. The ciphering is usually done by substituting each letter in a
  message by a letter that is on a fixed distance in the alfabet. TJvCaesarCipher
  uses the whole characterset (256 characters) for ciphering strings or series of bytes.
  This makes it possible to cipher any series of bytes (not necessarily readable strings).
  When used with strings it may result in strings that do not even look like strings
  anymore.

  Caesar Cipher is not a very save method to cipher text. When used with strings it is
  easy to crack.

  The component accepts a string, a list of strings (a TString object) or a stream for
  (de)ciphering.

  To use a JvCaesarCipher component
  * drop a TJvCaesarCipher on a form.
  * Set the property N to a value between 0 and 255, indicating the number of
    characters the characterset should be shifted. When used with strings a high value of N may 
    lead to a strings that are difficult to recognize as string.
  * Assign a string to the property Decoded and get the ciphered string by reading
    the property Encoded, or assign a ciphered string to the property Encoded and
    get the deciphered string by reading the property Decoded.
  * Use the methods Decode and Encode to (de)cipher TString objects.
  * Use the methods DecodeStream and EncodeStream to (de)cipher TStream objects.

@@TJvCaesarCipher.N
Summary
  The encrypting key for Ceasar Cipher, being the number of characters that a character or byte 
  will be shifted for (de)ciphering.
Description
  Assign a value to N to indicate how many characters the component should shift
  each character or byte for (de)ciphering. N=0 results in no ciphering, N=1 will
  change an A into a B, a C into a D etcetera. N=3 will change a B into a E, a K into
  a N etcetera.

  TJvCaesarCipher uses the whole characterset (256 characters) for shifting. When used with
  strings a high value of N may result in strings that are difficulet to recognize as a string.

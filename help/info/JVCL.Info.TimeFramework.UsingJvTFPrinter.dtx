<TITLE Using TJvTFPrinter in the JVCL Time Framework>
  Printer uses one of two different printing models, based upon the value of DirectPrint.

  If DirectPrint is TRUE:
    * Create a new document via <xxx>.
    * Call <xxx> to get a new page canvas. (<xxx>, <xxx>, and <xxx> are fired at this time. Each subsequent call to <xxx> sends the previous page directly to the printer.)
    * Call <xxx> to send the last page to the printer and close the print job.
    * Clean up used resources by calling <xxx>.

  If DirectPrint is FALSE:
    * Create a new document via <xxx>.
    * Call <xxx> to get a new page canvas. (<xxx> is fired for each new page. Each page is stored in memory and is NOT sent to the printer at this time.)
    * Call <xxx> to complete rendering the document. (<xxx> and <xxx> is fired for each page at this time. After FinishDoc executes, each page image is accessible via the property Pages.)
    * Call <xxx> to send the document to the printer.
    * Clean up used resources by calling <xxx>.

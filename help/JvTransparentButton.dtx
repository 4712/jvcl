Summary
  A button that can display images and text and also can align text and image in various ways.
Description
  Use TJvTransparentButton when you need a button that can:
    * display an image as well as text.
    * align the text and image in several positions.
    * use different frame colors.
    * be transparent or opaque.
    * display multi-line strings.
    * automatically create disabled and "hot" images.

  TJvTransparentButton is very similar to TJvTransparentButton2 but uses a bitmap instead of
  image lists for it's image. Using image lists is more resource friendly but can be more
  laborious to set up.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.AutoGray
Summary
  Specifies if a special, gray, image is displayed when the mouse is outside the button.
Description
  Use AutoGray to set whether the image on the button is automatically transformed to a gray
  scale image when the mouse leaves the button. When the mouse enters the button again, the image
  is displayed in color. This property only has effect if FrameStyle is fsExplorer and an Image is assigned.

@@TJvTransparentButton.BorderWidth
Summary
  Specifies the width of the button's border.
Description
  Use BorderWidth to get or set the width of the control’s border. Graphics or text drawn by the
  control is clipped to the area within the border.
See Also
  ClientRect
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.FrameStyle
Summary
  Specifies the appearance of the button's frame.
Description
  Use FrameStyle to specify the appearance of the button's frame. When FrameStyle is fsExplorer, the
  frame is only displayed when the mouse is inside the button.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.Glyph
Summary
  Specifies the bitmap that appears on the button.
Description
  Use the Open dialog box that appears as an editor in the Object Inspector to choose a bitmap file
  (with a .BMP extension) to use on the button, or specify a TBitmap object at runtime.

  You can provide up to four images within a single bitmap. All images must be the same size and
  next to each other in a row. Bit buttons display one of these images depending on their state.

  Image position	Button state	Description

  First	Up	This image appears when the button is up (unselected). This image is also used when the button has focus (for example, if the user tabs to it); in this case, a focus rectangle is drawn around the button. If no other images exist in the bitmap, bit buttons also use this image for all other states.
  Second	Disabled	This image usually appears dimmed to indicate that the button can't be selected.
  Third	Clicked	This image appears when the button is clicked. The Up image reappears when the user releases the mouse button.
  Fourth	Down	This image appears when the button stays down (indicating that it remains selected).

  If only one image is present, bit buttons attempt to represent the other states by altering the image
  slightly for the different states, although the Down state is always the same as the Up state. If
  you aren't satisfied with the results, you can provide additional images in the bitmap.

  If you have multiple images in a bitmap, you must specify the number of images that are in the
  bitmap with the NumGlyphs property.
Note
  The lower left pixel of the bitmap is reserved for the "transparent" color. Any pixel in
  the bitmap which matches that lower left pixel will be transparent.

  NumGlyphs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.NumGlyphs
Summary
  Indicates the number of images that are in the graphic specified in the
  Glyph property for use on the button.
Description
  If you have multiple images in a bitmap, you must specify the number of images that are in the bitmap
  with the NumGlyphs property. Valid NumGlyphs values are 1 to 4. The default value is 1.

  Glyph
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.Offset
Summary
  Determines how far the image and text is shifted when the button is pressed.
Description
  Use Offset to specify how far the image and text is moved on the button when the button is pressed.
  A value of 1 (the default) will shift the image and text one pixel to the right and 1 pixel down
  when the button is pressed. To achieve other effects, alter this value.

  This property only has meaning if ShowPressed is set to true.

  ShowPressed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.ShowPressed
Summary
  Specifies if the button is drawn in it's depressed state when the left mouse button is clicked on
  the button.
Description
  Use ShowPressed to set whether the button is drawn as a depressed button when the left mouse is
  clicked and held on the button. The normal behavior for a button is to show the user that it has been
  pressed by moving the image and text down and right 1 pixel but you can achieve other effects by setting
  this value to false.

  Offset
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.Spacing
Summary
  Determines where the image and text appear on the button.
Description
  Spacing determines the number of pixels between the image (specified in the Glyph property)
  and the text (specified in the Caption property). The default value is 4 pixels.

  If Spacing is a positive number, its value is the number of pixels between the image and text. If
  Spacing is 0, no pixels will be between the image and text. If Spacing is -1, the text appears
  centered between the image and the button edge. The number of pixels between the image and text is
  equal to the number of pixels between the text and the button edge opposite the glyph.

Summary
  Specifies where the text is placed on the button.

  Offset, Spacing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton.Transparent
Summary
  Specifies whether controls that sit below the control on a form can be seen through the control.
Description
  Set Transparent to true to prevent the control from obscuring other controls on the form. For
  example, if the control is used on top of a background image, set Transparent to true so that
  the control does not obscure the image more than necessary.

  Writing text so that the background is transparent is slower than writing text when
  Transparent is false. If the control is not obscuring a complicated image, performance can
  be improved by setting the background color of the control to match the object beneath
  it and setting Transparent to false.

@@TJvTransparentButton.WordWrap
Summary
  Specifies whether the text wraps when it is too long for the width of the control.
Description
  Set WordWrap to true to allow the control to display multiple line of text. When
  WordWrap is true, text that is too wide for the control wraps at the right margin
  and continues in additional lines.

  Set WordWrap to false to limit the text to a single line. When WordWrap is false, text that is too
  wide for the control appears truncated.

Summary
  A button that can display images and text and also can align text and image in various ways.
Description
  Use TJvTransparentButton2 when you need a button that can:
    * display an image from an imagelist as well as text.
    * display different images depending on it's state
    * align the text and image in several positions.
    * use different frame colors.
    * be transparent or opaque.
    * display multi-line strings.
    * automatically create disabled and "hot" images.

  TJvTransparentButton2 is very similar to TJvTransparentButton but uses imagelists instead of
  a bitmap image for it's image. Using imagelists is more resource friendly but can be more
  difficult to set up.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvTransparentButton2.ActiveImage
Summary
  Specifies the imagelist to get the active image from.
Description
  Use ActiveImage to specify the imagelist to extract the active image from. This is the only
  imagelist you need to set to be able to display an image in the button. If none of the other
  imagelists are set, the other three images are created automatically.
Note
  The button has four different imagelist properties you can assign to but they can all point
  to the same imagelist. The button also has four different image index properties to match
  the imagelists but these can also be set to the same value. Internally, the button creates
  a read-only imagelist (InternalList) that contains the selected images or the auto created
  images for the three other states (down, disabled, gray).

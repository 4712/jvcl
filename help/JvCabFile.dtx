<GROUP $JVCL.System.FilesAndFolders>
<TITLEIMG TJvCabFile>

Summary
  Encapsulates access to .CAB (cabinet) files using the Setup API.

Description

  TJvCabFile is a TJvComponent descendant that encapsulates access to .CAB
  (Cabinet) file using the Setup and Device Installer API. TJvCabFile
  has a dependency on the Setup and Device Installer API interface unit
  (SetupApi.pas) and the setupapi.dll file in Microsoft Windows.

  Cabinet files provide a file format that offers an efficient way to
  package and compress multiple files into a single file. TJvCabFile
  properties, methods, and events can be used when listing files stored in
  the .CAB, or when extracting files for subsequent use or installation.
  TJvCabFile does NOT provide methods for creating or populating .CAB
  files.  Use the CABARC.EXE utility to create or populate cabinet files.

  An application can assign procedures for the event handlers that
  correspond to notifications from the Setup API, including:

  <TABLE>
  Event Handler           Notification
  =====================   ============
  OnCabInfo               SPFILENOTIFY_CABINETINFO
  OnFilesListed           SPFILENOTIFY_FILEINCABINET
                          (general callback)
  OnFileExtracted         SPFILENOTIFY_FILEEXTRACTED
  OnStartFileExtraction   SPFILENOTIFY_FILEINCABINET
                          (extract callback)
  OnNeedNewCabinet        SPFILENOTIFY_NEEDNEWCABINET
  </TABLE>

  After assigning any relevant event handler procedures, set a value for
  the FileName property to gain access to the Files stored in the cabinet
  file.

  Call ExtractFile or ExtractAll to perform the desired file operation(s).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCabFile.Create

Summary
  Constructor for the object instance.

Parameters
  AOwner  - Owner of the object instance.

Description
  Create is the overridden constructor for the object instance.

  Create allocates resources needed for the Files property, and sets to the
  FileName for the cabinet file to an empty string ('').

  Create will attempt to load the setupapi.dll needed for the Setup and
  Device Installer API.  If setupapi.dll is not successfully loaded, Create
  will raise an EJVCLException exception.

  Set the FileName property value to begin working with files stored in the
  specified cabinet file.

  Resources allocated to the object instance, including the setupapi.dll,
  are released when the object is freed.

Description
  Destroy is the overridden destructor for the object instance.  Destroy
  frees resources allocated in the Create constructor, including the Files
  property, and unloads the setupapi.dll.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCabFile.ExtractAll

Summary
  Extracts files in a cabinet file to a specified path.

Parameters
  DestPath - The path where extracted files will be stored.

Description
  ExtractAll is a Boolean function that iterates over all files stored in a
  cabinet file, and extracts the files to the path specified in DestPath.
  ExtractAll insures that DestPath has a trailing path delimiter, and
  stores the value in the internal member variable reserved for that
  purpose.

  ExtractAll calls the SetupIterateCabinet function from the Setup API
  using the cabinet file identified in FileName and the internal callback
  function for file extraction.

  The return value for ExtractAll is True when SetupIterateCabinet
  completes successfully, or False if FileName does not exist or another
  Win32 error is encountered in the callback function.

  Use Files to access the file names stored in the cabinet file identified
  by FileName.

  Use ExtractFile to extract a specific file from the cabinet file
  identified in FileName to a specific destination path.

  Files, FileName, ExtractFile
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCabFile.ExtractFile

Summary
  Extracts a specific file to a destination path.

Parameters
  FileName  - File name to extract from the cabinet file.
  DestPath  - Path to use for storing the extracted file.

Description
  ExtractFile is a Boolean function that extracts the specified file in the
  cabinet file to a destination path.  FileName is a file name, as
  represented in Files, to extract from the cabinet file.  DestPath
  indicates the disk path to use for storing the extracted file contents.

  ExtractFile insures that DestPath has a trailing path delimiter, and
  appends the FileName argument to form a full path and file name for the
  extracted file.  ExtractFile stores the complete path and file name value
  in the internal member variable reserved for that purpose.

  ExtractFile calls the SetupIterateCabinet function from the Setup API
  using the cabinet file identified in the FileName property and the
  internal callback function for file extraction.

  The return value for ExtractFile is True when SetupIterateCabinet
  completes successfully, or False if FileName does not exist or another
  Win32 error is encountered in the callback function.

  Use Files to access the file names stored in the cabinet file identified
  by the FileName property.

  Use ExtractAll to extract all files from the cabinet file identified in
  the FileName property to a specific destination path.

@@TJvCabFile.FileName

Summary
  Identifies the cabinet file to use for file operations.

Description
  FileName is a TFileName property that identifies the fully-qualified file
  name for the cabinet file to use for file operations. Changing the value
  in FileName forces the Files property to be cleared and re-populated
  using the SetupIterateCabinet API function and the internal callback
  function.

  After successful completion of the file listing using the callback
  function, the OnFilesListed event is signalled.  Event notification is
  not performed if a procedure has not been assigned to the OnFilesListed
  event handler.

  FileName is used in ExtractFile and ExtractAll when calling the
  SetupIterateCabinet API function for the file operation.

@@TJvCabFile.Files

Summary
  Contains file names found in the cabinet file listing.

Description
  Files is a TStringList property that contains file names found in the
  cabinet file identified by FileName.  Files is cleared and automatically
  populated when the value in FileName is changed, and relies on the
  SetupIterateCabinet API function and the internal callback function.

  After successful completion of the file listing using the callback
  function, the OnFilesListed event is signalled.  Event notification is
  not performed if a procedure has not been assigned to the OnFilesListed
  event handler.

Summary
  Event handler signalled for cabinet file information.

Description
  OnCabInfo is a TOnCabInfo property that represents the event handler
  signalled when cabinet file information is returned to the internal
  callback function for the Setup API.

  OnCabInfo is signalled in the listing callback function when the
  SPFILENOTIFY_CABINETINFO notification is received, and provides access to
  the updated values in the TCabInfo argument to the event handler.

  Applications must assign a procedure to the event handler to allow
  responding to the event notification.

  Use OnNeedNewCabinet to respond to the event notification received when a
  file is continued in a different cabinet file in the extract callback
  function.

Description
  OnFileExtracted is a TOnExtracted property that represents the event
  handler signalled when a file has been extracted from the cabinet file
  using the Setup API.  OnFileExtracted is signalled when the
  SPFILENOTIFY_FILEEXTRACTED notification is received in the internal
  extraction callback function after a call to ExtractFile or ExtractAll.

  OnFileExtracted can be used to detect when the extraction is complete, or
  when a Win32 error has occurred during the Setup API function calls. The
  OnFileExtracted event handler can also be used to halt extraction of
  additional files, during execution of the ExtractAll method, by setting
  the Cont argument to False.

  Applications must assign a procedure to the event handler to allow
  responding to the event notification.

  Use OnStartFileExtraction to perform updates prior to performing the file
  operation.

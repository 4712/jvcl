@@TJvEmbeddedFormLink
Summary
  Makes a form embedable.
Description
  Drop a TJvEmbeddedFormLink on a form to make it embedable in a TJvEmbeddedFormPanel. The
  TJvEmbeddedFormLink instance needs to be assigned to the FormLink property of a
  TJvEmbeddedFormPanel on another form.

  To make the embedding work, you need to perform the following steps:
    * Drop a TJvEmbeddedFormLink on each form in your application that you want to be embedable. These forms
      must be auto-created by Delphi if you want to set up the links at design-time.
    * Drop one or more TJvEmbeddedFormPanels on each form that you want to embed other forms.
    * Add the forms with TJvEmbeddedFormLinks to the uses clause of the forms with TJvEmbeddedFormPanels.
    * Set the FormLink property of each TJvEmbeddedFormPanel to the TJvEmbeddedFormLink component of the
      form to embed. The embedded form should now be visible in the TJvEmbeddedFormPanel even at design-time.
Note
  You can only have one TJvEmbeddedFormLink on each form.

@@TJvEmbeddedFormPanel
Summary
  Provides a surface to embed a form in.
Description
  TJvEmbeddedFormPanel is a windowed control used to embed forms into. You use it along with a
  TJvEmbeddedFormLink on another form to link that form to the control.

  To make the embedding work, you need to perform the following steps:
    * Drop a TJvEmbeddedFormLink on each form in your application that you want to be embedable. These forms
      must be auto-created by Delphi if you want to set up the links at design-time.
    * Drop one or more TJvEmbeddedFormPanels on each form that you want to embed other forms.
    * Add the forms with TJvEmbeddedFormLinks to the uses clause of the forms with TJvEmbeddedFormPanels.
    * Set the FormLink property of each TJvEmbeddedFormPanel to the TJvEmbeddedFormLink component of the
      form to embed. The embedded form should now be visible in the TJvEmbeddedFormPanel even at design-time.
Note
  You can have multiple TJvEmbeddedFormPanels on each form and TJvEmbeddedFormPanels can be nested.

@@TJvEmbeddedInstanceFormPanel
Summary
  Provides a surface to embed a form in.
Description
  TJvEmbeddedInstanceFormPanel derives from TJvEmbeddedFormPanel but creates a free-standing
  instance of the specified form class instead of referring to a common, auto-created instance.
  With this control, each control has its own instance of the specified form and thus isn't affected by
  changes made to the form in other TJvEmbeddedFormPanel controls.

@@TJvCustomGraphicButton.AllowAllUp
Summary
  Specifies whether all buttons in a group can be unselected at the same time.
Description
  Use AllowAllUp with a group of buttons that belong to the same group. Buttons belong to the same
  group if they have the same value on their GroupIndex property. Buttons in the same group behave in a
  mutually exclusive fashion: when one button in the group is selected (down), all other buttons in the
  group become unselected (up).

  If AllowAllUp is True, all of the buttons in a group can be unselected at the same time. Clicking the
  single selected button in the group will deselect that button without selecting another. If
  AllowAllUp is False, exactly one of the buttons in the group must be selected at any time. Clicking a
  down button won't return the button to its up state.

  Changing the value of the AllowAllUp property for one button in a group changes the AllowAllUp value
  for all buttons in the group.
Note
  If GroupIndex is zero, AllowAllUp has no effect.

  Down, GroupIndex

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCustomGraphicButton.Down
Summary
  Specifies whether the button is selected (down) or unselected (up).
Description
  Read Down to determine whether a button is selected. The Down property only applies if the GroupIndex
  property of the button is nonzero.

  When GroupIndex is greater than 0, set Down to True to select a button. When the user clicks on a
  button in the unselected (up) state, the button is selected and Down is set to True. When the user
  clicks on a button in the selected (down) state, if AllowAllUp is True, the button becomes unselected
  and Down is set to False.

  At design time, specify which button in a group is the initially selected button by setting the Down
  property of the selected button to True.
Note
  When GroupIndex is 0, buttons do not remain in the selected state when clicked.

Description
  Set ForceSameSize to true for all buttons that should have the same size. When the size of one of the

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvCustomGraphicButton.GroupIndex
Summary
  Allows buttons to work together as a group.
Description
  Set GroupIndex to determine how the button behaves when clicked.

  When GroupIndex is 0, the button behaves independently of all other buttons on the form. When the
  user clicks such a button, the button appears pressed (in its clicked state) and then returns to its
  normal up state when the user releases the mouse button.

  When GroupIndex is greater than 0, the button remains selected (in its down state) when clicked by
  the user. When the user clicks a selected button, it returns to the up state, unless AllowAllUp is
  False. Setting the G oupIndex property of a single button to a value greater than 0 causes the button
  to behave as a two-state button when AllowAllUp is True.

  Buttons with the same GroupIndex property value (other than 0), work together as a group. When the
  user clicks one of these buttons, it remains selected until the user clicks another button in the
  same group. Buttons used in this way can present mutually exclusive choices to the user, much like
  radio buttons.

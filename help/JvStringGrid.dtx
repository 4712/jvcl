<GROUP JVCL.GridsAndContent.Grids>
Summary
  Supports extended features such as alternative cell alignment, sorting, loading and saving a grid.
Description
  Call method SortGrid to sort the grid. Call method SaveToCSV, SaveToFile or SaveToStream to save the
  grid to a stream or file. Call method LoadFromCSV, LoadFromFile or LoadFromStream to load the grid 
  from a file or stream. 
  
  You can use OnMouseEnter and OnMouseLeave to alter the grids look or behavoir, when the user 
  moves the mouse pointer over the control.
  
  Property HintColor can be used to set a different color of the Help hint boxes for the grid.
  
  Use Alignment to set the default alignment for the grid. Write an OnGetCellAlignment event handler
  to provide the grid with an alignment for a specific cell. 
  
  Call InvalidateCell, InvalidateCol or InvalidateRow to repaint a cell, column or row, respectively.
  
  Call ActivateCell to set the input focus to a specific cell. Write an OnExitCell event handler to 
  respend when the input focus shifts away from a cell.

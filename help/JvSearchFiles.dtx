<TITLEIMG TJvSearchFiles>
<GROUP JVCL.System.FilesAndFolders>
Summary
  Enables you to search for files and directories.
Description
  Use TJvSearchFiles to perform a search operation for files and directories.

  First use the properties of TJvSearchFiles to specify how and what to search for:
  
  * Use RootDirectory to specify the start directory for the search. 
  * Use DirOption to specify whether the component must only scan the start directory, must also scan in
    valid - as specified by DirParams - sub-directories or must scan in all sub-directories.
  * Use ErrorResponse to specify how a TJvSearchFiles component should react on errors.
  * Use FileParams to specify which files are included in the search result. \Include soSearchFiles in
    Options to actually search for files.
  * Use DirParams to specify which directories are included in the search result. If DirOption is 
    set to doExcludeInvalidDirs or doExcludeCompleteInvalidDirs then DirParams also limits the search
    to sub-directories that match to the parameters specified by DirParams.
    \Include soSearchDirs in Options to actually search for directories.
  * Use Options to specify various behavioral properties of the search component.
  
  Some work can be done by the component or by the user:
  
  * TJvSearchFiles can store all found files and directories in Files and Directories resp., or this can be done
    by the user in response of OnFindFile and OnFindDirectory events. \Include soOwnerData in Options to 
    let the component <i>not</i> store found files and directories.
  * FileParams and DirParams can be used to limit the search result to files and directories that match the
    parameters described by these objects; or this can be done by the user in reponse of the OnCheck event.

  After setting these properties you can call Search to start the search operation. \Now the following events
  will be triggered during the search operation:
  
  * OnBeginScanDir: when the component starts scanning a directory.
  * OnCheck: when the component needs to check if a file or directory is valid. If you don't write an
    OnCheck event handler, then the component uses the DirParams and FileParams object to determine if a
    file or directory is valid.
  * OnFindFile: when the component finds a valid file.
  * OnFindDirectory: when the component finds a valid directory.
  * OnAbort: when the user aborts the search operation by calling Abort.
  
  While searching the component updates the TotalDirectories, TotalFiles, and TotalFileSize properties, if
  a file or directory is found.
    
  Eventually the search operation will end with result False, if an error occurred or the user did 
  abort the operation; or otherwise with result True.
  
  For examples on how to search for specific file, look <LINK TJvSearchFiles_Example, here>.

@@TJvSearchFiles.Search
Summary
  Searches for files or directories.
Description
  Call Search to start a search operation. If soSearchFiles is included in Options, then Search will
  search for files. If soSearchDirs is included in Options, then Search will search for directories.
  
  Use RootDirectory to specify the start directory for the search. Use DirOption to specify whether 
  Search must only scan the start directory or must also include it's sub-directories.
  
  Each time a valid directory - as specified by DirParams - is found, the component updates TotalDirectories 
  and TotalFileSize, triggers the OnFindDirectory event and adds the directory name to Directories (if 
  soOwnerData isn't included in Options).
  
  Each time a valid file - as specified by FileParams - is found, the component updates TotalFiles
  and TotalFileSize, triggers the OnFindFile event and adds the file name to Files (if soOwnerData isn't
  included in Options).

  Eventually Search will end with result False, if an error occurred or the user did 
  abort the operation; or otherwise with result True.

@@TJvSearchParams
Summary
  Represents a filter for files and directories.
Description
  TJvSearchFiles uses the TJvSearchParams object to limit the search result to files and directories
  whose parameters match with the parameters described by the TJvSearchParams object.
  
  Use SearchTypes to specify the parameters that a file or directory must be matched to, to decide
  whether it can be added to the search results. 
  
  You can filter out files and directories by the following parameters:
  
  * Use Attributes to limit the search results to files and directories that have specific attributes.
  * Use FileMasks to limit the search results to files and directories whose name match a certain
    mask.
  * Use MinSize and MaxSize to limit the search results to files and directories with an specific file
    size. 
  * Use LastChangeAfter and LastChangeBefore to limit the search results to files and directores that
    are last changed or created in an specific time period.
    
  Alternatively, you can write an <LINK TJvSearchFiles.OnCheck,OnCheck> event handler to filter out
  files and diretories by yourself.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSearchParams.Attributes
Summary
  Points to a attribute filter for files and directories.
Description
  Use Attributes to limit the search results to files and directories whose file attributes match to
  values represented by Attributes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSearchParams.Check
Summary
  Checks whether a file or directory is valid.
Description
  A TJvSearchFiles component calls Check to determine if a file or directory is valid. Check will 
  match the parameters of a file or directory to the values specified by SearchTypes.
Parameters
  AFindData - Describes the file or directory that must be checked.

@@TJvSearchParams.FileMask
Summary
  Lists the masks in the FileMasks as a single string with the individual strings delimited by the
  character specified by FileMaskSeperator.
Description
  Use FileMask to get or set all the masks in FileMasks in a single string delimited by the character
  specified by FileMaskSeperator.
See Also
  FileMasks, FileMaskSeperator, SearchTypes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@TJvSearchParams.FileMasks
Summary
  Contains file masks used to limit the search results.
Description
  Set each item in FileMasks to a regular expression to limit the search results to files and directories 
  that match at least one of the masks in FileMasks. The value of a mask is a filename which can contain 
  wildcard characters (* and ?). The asterisk (*) is a wildcard which matches any number of arbitrary 
  characters. The question mark (?) is a wildcard which matches a single arbitrary character.

  Use FileMasks to add, insert, delete and move file masks. Use properties and methods for string
  lists to manipulate the items in the list. 

  stFileMask must be included in SearchTypes, otherwise the name of a file or directory will not be 
  matched with the masks in FileMasks to determine if a file or directory is valid. If stFileMask
  is included in SearchTypes but FileMasks contains no masks, then all files and directories are
  valid for this match.
  
  \Include stFileMaskCaseSensitive in SearchTypes to compare the name of a file or directory 
  case-sensitive with the masks in FileMasks.

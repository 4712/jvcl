<h2>Installation Notes for JVCL</h2>
<h3>
    <hr >
</h3>
<h3>Current version</h3>
<p>The current version of JVCL is 3.00</p>
<h3>Supported compiler versions</h3>
<p>The following compilers are supported by the JVCL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delphi 5</li>
  <li>Delphi 6</li>
  <li>Delphi 7</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Uninstalling previous versions of JVCL</h3>
<p>If you have a previous version of the JVCL installed, you must remove it 
completely along with the JCL before installing this version. To remove a 
previous installation, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start Delphi/BCB, open the packages page by selecting Component|Install 
  Packages.</li>
  <li>Select each of the JCL / JVCL packages in the list and click the "Remove" 
  button</li>
  <li>Open Tools|Environment Options|Library and remove all library paths 
  pointing to JVCL and JCL folders. </li>
  <li>Repeat step 1 to 3 for every version of Delphi/BCB you have installed</li>
  <li>Browse to the folder where your bpl and dcp files are located (default is 
  ($DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl). Delete all of the files related to JVCL and JCL</li>
  <li>Delete or rename the top folder where JCL and JVCL is installed.</li>
  <li>Start regedit (click Start|Run, type regedit.exe and hit Enter). Open the 
  key <font face="Courier New" 
  size="2">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\&lt;compiler&gt;\&lt;version&gt;\Palette</font> 
  and delete all name/value items in the list related to JVCL. (&lt;compiler&gt; 
  is either "Delphi" or "C++Builder", &lt;version&gt; is the version of 
  Delphi/BCB you have installed).</li></ol>
<h3>Getting required packages</h3>
<p>JVCL requires that you also install the latest version of JCL (JEDI Code 
Library). You can get the latest vesion of JCL from this location: XXXXX.</p>
<h3>Manual install</h3>
<p>Start by unpacking the JVCL and JCL zip files into a folder of your own 
choice. Make sure your zip extractor is set to maintain folder structure or all 
files will be put into the same folder (<strong>not </strong>what you want!). 
</p>
<p>Since JVCL assumes that the JCL is installed in the same base folder as JVCL, 
the JCL and JVCL folders must be created as siblings, i.e after installation, 
your folder structure should look like this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">JEDI<br>&nbsp; JCL<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JCL 
subfolders&gt;<br>&nbsp; JVCL<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JVCL 
subfolders&gt;<br></font></p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">&nbsp;</p></FONT>

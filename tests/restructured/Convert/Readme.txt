----------------------
The "JVCL Convert" will compile ONLY under Delphi 6
---------------------

The "JVCL Convert" is a program to help you with conversion of any projects utilizing RxLib to JVCL components.

In order to use it, please follow the steps below:

- open "JVCL Convert"

- select files to convert: you can do it in three different ways:

a) drag & drop from a Windows Explorer
b) select a subdirectory and scan all Delphi files (*.pas, *.dpr, *.dpk) in it and its subdirectories
c) Open and select individual files

- once the files are selected, you can remove some of them, if needed

- open a RxLib.dat file. It contains all the RxLib related strings that need to be replaced

- click on the convert icon.

Please note: for best results, you should leave all the Options as they are, i.e. checked in, especially the "Whole words only"

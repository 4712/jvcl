This package contains a couple of components and some classes for design support,
a demo and a registration units.

Run-time:

JvPageLinkTreeView.pas
Contains the components TJvPageListTreeView, TJvPageList, TJvSettingsTreeView
and their TCustom variants. For more info on each, read the source (Luke)


Design-time:

JvPageLinkTreeviewReg.pas/.dcr
Registration units for components, property and component editors


JvTreeItemsEditor.pas/.dfm

Since I wanted to derive the treeview(s) from TCustomTreeView and
still retain the behaviour of a normal treeview (double-click it to open
the Items Editor) and couldn't find the unit where this editor is
impelemented, I had to make my own. This editor further have some advantages
over the standard editor: the dialog is resizable, the images from any
imagelists are drawn in the appropriate combobox,  you can Load *and* Save the
Items...

One other benefit is that the registration file registers this editor for the
TCustomTreeVIew class, so if you install it, you will have automatic access to
this editor from any TCustomTreeView derived component (except those derived from
TTreeView directly since the standard editor is registered for that component)

JvPageLinkEditor.pas/.dfm
Contains a property editor for the PageLinks property in TJvCustomPageListTreeView

Since these components doesn't work with anything below D6,
I haven't bothered to insert any IFDEF's to cater for it, no rinlcuded the JVCL.INC file.

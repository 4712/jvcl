Install notes for JEDI-VCL (JVCL) Version 1.30 for Delphi 6
===========================================

(NOTE: this release does NOT support Delphi 5. Any help to make it D5-compatible will be appreciated)


1) IMPORTANT - in order to use JVCL, you need to have JCL (JEDI Code Library) INSTALLED on your computer. JCL is available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/

2) Unzip the JVCL files to a subdirectory of your choice (IMPORTANT: it should be a sibling to the JCL subdirectory)

3) In Delphi open the appropriate design package that is in the "Packages" subdirectory. 
    a) for Delphi 6 it's "JVCL100_D6.dpk" 
    b) for Delphi 6 Personal it's "JVCL100_D60Personal.dpk"


4) Click on the "Install" button

 If you get compile error stating that zlib.pas, or some *.obj files are missing, please make sure that in your packages following paths:

$(DELPHI)\source\extras\zlib\
$(DELPHI)\source\extras\zlib\obj

are in your Search path ( click on package Options, and then on "Directories" tab)

Of course, you need to install those files from Delphi first. If the EXTRAS subdirectory doesn't exist, please install the files from your Delphi CD.

5) The window showing all the components that have been installed will be very big, and most probably you won't see the "OK" button, so just close the window. You should have JVCL installed on your PC.

JEDI VCL for D6 (alpha 2.00)
(http://jvcl.sourceforge.net)

The JEDI VCL  (JVCL) for D6 consists of a set of visual components which can be instantly reused in your Delphi 6 projects.

The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. Please note that this is an alpha release, and as such, there is still a lot of work to do. There has been a significant merging/refactoring since version 1.3 and this means, among other things, that some components have disappeared and others have been equipped with new capabilities. Please read restruct_changelog.txt and restruct_demochanges.txt for details on what has changed since 1.3 and to give you a hint on how to move your code from 1.3 to 2.0. Your involvement and help in improving JVCL and finding bugs would be very much appreciated.

JVCL is released to the public under the terms of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) and as such can be freely used in both freeware/shareware, opensource and commercial projects. The MPL does have a few restrictions and we urge you to read the MPL (at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html) and MPL FAQ documents available in the JCL-Help.chm file.

- Contents of the JEDI Code Library
\Bin
Output folder for EXE files generated by the examples. NOTE that some of the examples rely on the EXE to be in the same folder as the example file(s). Move the EXE to the original folder if you encounter errors when running a demo.

\Common
This directory contains units that are or might be shared among different JEDI projects

\Source
This directory contains all the source code units for the JEDI VCL.

\ Packages
Contains the package files needed for JVCL installation

\Help
Contains the JVCL Helpfile. This helpfile is currently incomplete. 

\Examples
Contains example projects demonstrating some of the components in the JVCL. 
\lib5
Output folder for DCU files when compiling for Dephi 5
\lib6
Output folder for DCU files when compiling for Dephi 6 or Delphi 6 Personal


NOTE: to compile all examples at once, just run the "CompileExamples.bat" batch file. The JVCL has to be a SIBLING subdirectory to JCL (on the same level) for this to succeed.

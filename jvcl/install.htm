<h1>Installation Notes for JVCL</h1>
<h3> </h3>
<hr>
<h2>Current version</h2>
<p>The current version of JVCL is 3.00 alpha minus, released on
YYYY-MM-DD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Supported compiler versions</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following compilers are supported by the JVCL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delphi 5</li>
  <li>Delphi 6</li>
  <li>Delphi 7</li>
  <li>C++ Builder 5</li>
  <li>C++ Builder 6<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Uninstalling previous versions of JVCL</h2>
<p>If you have a previous version of the JVCL installed (i.e 2.10 or
earlier), you must remove it completely along with the JCL before
installing this version. To remove a previous installation, proceed as
follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start the IDE, open the packages page by selecting <b>Component
- Install   Packages</b>.</li>
  <li>Select each of the JCL / JVCL packages in the list and click the <b>Remove</b>
button</li>
  <li>Open <b>Tools - Environment Options - Library</b> and remove all
library paths pointing to JVCL and JCL folders. </li>
  <li>Repeat step 1 to 3 for every version of Delphi and C++ Builder
you have installed</li>
  <li>Close the IDE<br>
  </li>
  <li>Browse to the folder where your bpl and dcp files are located
(default is $(DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl for Delphi, $(BCB)\Projects\Bpl for
C++ Builder). Delete all of the files related to JVCL and JCL</li>
  <li>Delete or rename the top folder where JCL and JVCL is installed.</li>
  <li>Start regedit (click <b>Start - Run</b>, type "regedit.exe" and
hit <b>Enter</b>). Open the   key <font face="Courier New" size="1">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\&lt;compiler&gt;\&lt;version&gt;\Palette</font>
and delete all name/value items in the list related to JVCL.
(&lt;compiler&gt; is either "Delphi" or "C++Builder", &lt;version&gt; is
the IDE version you have installed). </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Getting required packages</h2>
<p align="left">JVCL requires that you also install the latest version
of JCL (JEDI Code Library). Currently, this is the JCL Preview, but
newer versions might have been released since this document was
published. Instructions on where to download JCL can be found on this
page: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl</a>.<br>
As of today (30th of September 2003), the JCL package must be updated
with numerous bug fixes. For your convenience, these bug fixes are
included in the distribution file but please note that as soon as the
JCL group does a new release, we recommend you use it instead as it will
include our fixes plus many others.<br>
</p>
<h2>Manual install for Delphi<br>
</h2>
<p>Start by unpacking the JVCL and JCL zip files into a folder of your
own choice. Make sure your zip extractor is set to maintain folder
structure or all files will be put into the same folder (<b>not</b> what
you want!). </p>
<p>Since JVCL assumes that the JCL is installed in the same base folder
as JVCL, the JCL and JVCL folders must be created as siblings, i.e the
folder structure should look like this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">JEDI<br>
&nbsp; JCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JCL subfolders&gt;<br>
&nbsp; JVCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JVCL subfolders&gt;<br>
</font></p>
<p>Start Delphi, open the package group file (bpg) for your version of
Delphi that is located in the jvcl\packages folder. Select <b>Project -
Build All Projects</b> from the Delphi menu. Go get a cup of coffee
(this takes a while). After Delphi has compiled all the packages, open
the <b>Project Manager</b> (Ctrl+Alt+F11) and right-click each of the
packages ending with D?D (where ? is the version number, "5" for Delphi
5, "6" for Delphi 6 etc) and select "<b>Install</b>" from the pop-up
menu. Although you can skip installing some of the packages, we still
recommend that you install all of them the first time. You can later
remove some of them on a project by project basis or permanently if you
never use the components in the package and the package isn't required
by another installed package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have several versions of Delphi installed, you will have to
go through these steps for each version, the only difference being the
bpg file you load into the IDE.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<div class="InfoField"> When closing a package, Delphi will prompt you
to save the changes to the package. You can answer "No" to this question
since saving only updates the dof file and that is not necessary. <br>
</div>
<br>
<h2>Adding JVCL paths to Delphi</h2>
<p>To make your applications find the JVCL code when you compile, you
need to add the paths to JVCL to Delphi's environment paths. You have
two options: either add the paths to the JVCL source files or add the
paths to the precompiled DCU files. Both have their drawbacks and
benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding the source paths means you can easily make changes to the
source and see it at run-time but be aware that if you build with
run-time packages, you need to recompile the packages to see the
changes in the application. To add the source folder locations to
Delphi, select <b>Tools-Environment Options-Library</b> and add the
paths to JCL\source, JVCL\run and JVCL\common to the Library path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding the pre-compiled DCU paths means that Delphi won't recompile
the DCU's unless you recompile the packages so compiling your
application should be faster. To add the DCU folder location, select <b>Tools-Environment
Options-Library</b> and add JCL\dcu, JVCL\libX (where X is your version
of Delphi, i.e for Delphi 6, it's "6") and JVCL\common (for the INC
files) to the Library path. If you still want to be able to open the
JVCL source files in the IDE, add JVCL\run (and maybe even JVCL\design)
to the Browsing Path list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font size="2">Reinstalling </font> and<font size="2"> updating for
Delphi<br>
</font></h2>
<p>To reinstall or update a package, use the same approach as in the <b>Manual
Install</b> section above with the following additions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Delphi 5, uninstall all affected JVCL packages before
rebuilding. Delphi 5 has a problem updating already installed packages,
especially when     the package have dependencies. Delphi 6 and Delphi 7
handles this better but     you are recommended to remove them anyway
since it minimizes the probability     of errors. To uninstall, select <b>Component
- Install Package</b>, select the JVCL packages in the list and click
the <b>Remove</b> button. Click <b>OK</b> to close the     dialog (if
you click Cancel the packages will not be removed).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Manual install for C++ Builder<br>
</h2>
<p>Start by unpacking the JVCL and JCL zip files into a folder of your
own choice. Make sure your zip extractor is set to maintain folder
structure or all files will be put into the same folder (<b>not</b> what
you want!). </p>
<p>The JVCL for C++ Builder doesn't assume that the JCL is installed in
the same base folder as JVCL, but we do recommend that the JCL and JVCL
folders are created as siblings, i.e the folder structure should look
like this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">JEDI<br>
&nbsp; JCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JCL subfolders&gt;<br>
&nbsp; JVCL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JVCL subfolders&gt;<br>
</font></p>
<p><br>
Open the JCL package specific to your version of C++&nbsp;Builder. It
is called CJCLxx.bpk where xx is to be replaced by 50 for
C++&nbsp;Builder&nbsp;5 and 60 for C++&nbsp;Builder&nbsp;6. Click the
compile button, wait for about 2 minutes and if the compilation went
well, close the package (File, Close All). Do NOT save it.</p>
<p> Now, open the package group file (bpg) for your version of
C++&nbsp;Builder that is located in the jvcl\packages folder. Select <b>Project
- Build All Projects</b> from the C++&nbsp;Builder menu. Go get a cup of
coffee (this takes a long while, about 10 minutes). For some annoying
reason it is possible that C++&nbsp;Builder will complain about .bpi
files. This is because the last packages in the list require the first
ones to be compiled and of course they are not at the beginning. If you
know a way to turn that off, please let us know. An alternative
solution is to right-click in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project
Manager</span> and select 'Build' for each package in turn. After all
packages are compiled, open the <b>Project Manager</b> (Ctrl+Alt+F11)
and right-click each of the packages ending with C?D (where ? is the
version number, "5" for C++&nbsp;Builder 5, "6" for C++&nbsp;Builder 6)
and select "<b>Install</b>" from the pop-up menu. You must start from
the beginning of the list or some packages may not be able to get
installed. Although you can skip installing some of the packages, we
still recommend that you install all of them the first time. You can
later remove some of them on a project by project basis or permanently
if you never use the components in the package and the package isn't
required by another installed package.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
If you have several versions of C++&nbsp;Builder installed, you will
have to go through these steps for each version, the only difference
being the bpg file you load into the IDE.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>By respecting the structure we indicate, you shouldn't have any
trouble compiling and installing the JVCL. However, some users do not
want to put the JVCL and JCL together and this triggers some problems.
It is possible to have the JCL and the JVCL in seperate locations but
you'll have to follow these steps for everything to work:</p>
<p> Ensure that C++&nbsp;Builder is closed, and add the dcu subdirectory
of JCL to the PATH environment variable. For instance, if you chose
c:\mypath as the root for the JCL, you must add 'c:\mypath\jcl\dcu' to
the PATH environment variable. Under Windows 2000 and XP, this is done
by opening the 'System properties' applet from the 'Control panel'. You
can either simultaneously press the Windows key and the Pause key or go
through <span style="font-weight: bold;">Start - Parameters -
Control&nbsp;panel - System&nbsp;properties</span>. Once in the applet,
choose the 'Advanced' tab and click on the 'Environment variables'
button at the bottom. Depending on wether or not you want the changes
to apply to yourself or all users, choose the PATH variable for one of
the two list and click the related 'Modify' button. Add
';c:\jedi\jcl\dcu' (without the quotes) at the end of the already
existing value, and click on Ok buttons until the 'System properties'
applet is closed. This modification is required because C++&nbsp;Builder
(at least version 6) parses this value when it searches for libraries
and there are no direct way in the IDE to specify additional library
paths (contrary to Delphi). You may also use overrides in the
environment options, but this has not been tested. If doing so works,
please let us know.<br>
</p>
<p> Start C++&nbsp;Builder, go to <b>Tools - Environment Options -
Library - Library Path</b> and add the paths to JCL\source, JCL\dcu,
JVCL\run, JVCL\design, JVCL\common and JVCL\resources to the list of
library paths.</p>
<p>You should now be able to compile and install the JCL and the JVCL
by following the same directives as in a standard installation<br>
</p>
<p> <br>
</p>
<div class="InfoField"> When closing a package, C++&nbsp;Builder will
prompt you to save the changes to the package. You MUST answer "No" to
this question since saving will most likely render the packages unusable
for the next time you want to compile the JVCL.<br>
</div>

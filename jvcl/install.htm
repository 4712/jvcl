<h2>Installation Notes for JVCL</h2>
<h3>
    </h3>
    <hr >
<h3>Current version</h3>
<p>The current version of JVCL is 3.00, released on YYYY-MM-DD</p>
<h3>Supported compiler versions</h3>
<p>The following compilers are supported by the JVCL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delphi 5</li>
  <li>Delphi 6</li>
  <li>Delphi 7</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="InfoField">
  The term &quot;Delphi&quot; is used to refer to the IDE but the same instructions are applicable to C++Builder
  and Kylix in most circumstances. When that is not the case, it is noted in the text.
</div>
<h3>Uninstalling previous versions of JVCL</h3>
<p>If you have a previous version of the JVCL installed (i.e 2.10 or earlier), you must remove it 
completely along with the JCL before installing this version. To remove a 
previous installation, proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start Delphi, open the packages page by selecting <b>Component - Install 
  Packages</b>.</li>
  <li>Select each of the JCL / JVCL packages in the list and click the <b>Remove</b> button</li>
  <li>Open <b>Tools - Environment Options - Library</b> and remove all library paths pointing to JVCL and JCL folders. </li>
  <li>Repeat step 1 to 3 for every version of Delphi you have installed</li>
  <li>Browse to the folder where your bpl and dcp files are located (default is ($DELPHI)\Projects\Bpl). Delete all of the files related to JVCL and JCL</li>
  <li>Delete or rename the top folder where JCL and JVCL is installed.</li>
  <li>Start regedit (click <b>Start - Run</b>, type &quot;regedit.exe&quot; and hit <b>Enter</b>). Open the 
  key <font face="Courier New" size="1">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Borland\&lt;compiler&gt;\&lt;version&gt;\Palette</font> 
  and delete all name/value items in the list related to JVCL. (&lt;compiler&gt; 
  is either "Delphi" or "C++Builder", &lt;version&gt; is the IDE version you have installed).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3>Getting required packages</h3>
<p align="left">JVCL requires that you also install the latest version of JCL (JEDI Code 
Library). Instructions on where to download JCL can be found on this page: <a href="http://jcl.sourceforge.net">http://jcl.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>
<h3>Manual install</h3>
<p>Start by unpacking the JVCL and JCL zip files into a folder of your own 
choice. Make sure your zip extractor is set to maintain folder structure or all 
files will be put into the same folder (<b>not</b> what you want!). 
</p>
<p>Since JVCL assumes that the JCL is installed in the same base folder as JVCL, 
the JCL and JVCL folders must be created as siblings, i.e the folder structure should look like this:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">JEDI<br>&nbsp; JCL<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JCL 
subfolders&gt;<br>&nbsp; JVCL<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;JVCL 
subfolders&gt;<br></font></p>
<p>Start Delphi, open the package group file (bpg) for your version of Delphi
that is located in the jvcl\packages folder. Next, go to <b>Tools - Environment
Options - Library - Library Path</b> and add the paths to JCL\source, JVCL\run and
JVCL\common to the list of library paths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select <b>Project - Build All Projects</b> from the Delphi menu. Go get a cup
of coffee (this takes a while). After Delphi has compiled all the packages, open
the <b>Project Manager</b> (Ctrl+Alt+F11) and right-click each of the packages
ending with D?D (where ? is the version number, &quot;5&quot; for Delphi 5,
&quot;6&quot; for Delphi 6 etc) and select &quot;<b>Install</b>&quot; from the
pop-up menu. Although you can skip installing some of the packages, we still
recommend that you install all of them the first time. You can later remove some
of them on a project by project basis or permanently if you never use the
components in the package and the package isn't required by another installed
package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have several versions of Delphi/BCB installed, you will have to go
through these steps for each version, the only difference being the bpg file you
load into the IDE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="InfoField">
When closing a package, Delphi will prompt you to save the changes to the package. You can answer &quot;No&quot; to this question since it only updates
the dof files
</div>
<h3><font size="2">Reinstalling and updating</font></h3>
<p>To reinstall or update a package, use the same approach as in the <b>Manual
Install</b> section above with the following additions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Delphi 5, uninstall all affected JVCL packages before rebuilding.
    Delphi 5 has a problem updating already installed packages, especially when
    the package have dependencies. Delphi 6 and Delphi 7 handles this better but
    you are recommended to remove them anyway since it minimizes the probability
    of errors. To uninstall, select <b>Component - Install Package</b>, select the JVCL
    package in the list and click the <b>Remove</b> button. Click <b>OK</b> to close the
    dialog (if you click Cancel the package will not be removed).</li>
</ul>

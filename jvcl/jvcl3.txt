Dev folders for moving JVCL to 3.0

TODO:
* Split packages into several smaller packages
  Naming convention:
    Jv<name><compiler>(D|R).dpk/.bpk
    where 
    <name> - the descriptive name of the package, i.e "Core" for the core package
    <compiler> - a short name for the compiler. The following names should be used: D5, D6, D7, B5, B6, K2 and K3
    (D|R) - signifies if it's a design- (D) or run-time (R) package
  Example:
    JvCoreB5R.bpk - core run-time package for BCB 5
    JvCoreD7D.dpk - core design-time package for Delphi 7

  Probable packages (base name only):
    JvCore - core units, support units
    JvCmp - non-visual components
    JvSystem - system related components
    JvCtrls - visual controls
    JvStdCtrls - enhanced standard controls
    JvCustom - custom components
    JvNet - network (modem WAN, LAN etc) related components
    JvMM - multimedia and images
    JvCrypt - encryption and compression
    JvDlgs - dialog components
    JvInterpreter - JvInterpreter components
    JvAppFrm - Application and Form components
    JvDB - non-db specific DB components
    JvBDE - bde specific DB components
    JvOther - deprecated, duplicated or non-conformant

* Each design package has it's own reg file named from the package (i.e reg unit for JvCoreD7D.dpk is named JvCoreReg.pas). 
  Design editors may have a register procedure in it's own unit, 
  but this is discouraged, especially for new units
* Put packages for each compiler version in it's own folder
  Package folder names hould be d5, d6, d7,bcb5,bcb6,k2 and k3
* Put sources for design and run-time in separate folders
* Put resources in a common folder. This folder is \resources
* Put INC and common files (like API translations) in a common folder. This folder is \common.
* Merge/remove remaining duplicates
* Change palette layout
* Create one DCR file for each design package
* Implement IFiller
* Implement XP theming
* Add remaining donations:

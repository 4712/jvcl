The JEDI Visual Component Library (JVCL) consists of a large collection (currently ca. 500)
visual and non-visual components which can be instantly reused in your Delphi, Kylix and
C++ Builder projects.

The library is built upon code donated from the JEDI community. It is reformatted to achieve
a common look-and-feel, tested, documented and merged into the library. The library is grouped
into several categories such as Enhanced Standard, Visual, Non-Visual, Data Aware and many,
many more. The library is released to the public under the terms of the Mozilla Public License
(MPL) and as such can be freely used in both freeware, shareware, open source and commercial
projects.

Source code files included in the JVCL have a header which explicitly states the license (as
is required). However, unless noted otherwise, all files, including those without an MPL
header, are subject to the MPL license.

<h2>Administrator Help</h2>
<hr>
<p dir="ltr">This document tries to provide the information necessary for an individual to run the JVCL project. The purpose of this 
document is to ease the way for new admins and to remind current admins about the tasks might they have to perform to make things in JVCL 
run smoothly and also to remind them on how these tasks are most easily performed. Additionally, this document lists common practices used 
today within the JVCL to complete these tasks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowhere in this document will you find login information or other sensitive information, so if that is what you came here looking for, 
the door is that way. All passwords and URLs to private webbpages etc are (and must be) passed from one admin to the next via private, 
secured channels (anyone smelling a secret society here?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What do admins do?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's some of the more common tasks an admin might perform:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keeps the big picture in mind and makes sure the general direction of the project is sound</li>
  <li>Adds and removes developers from the project</li>
  <li>Has the final say on what to add and what to remove from the sources</li>
  <li>Handles official communications with other parties</li>
  <li>Makes sure the web site is maintained and up to date</li>
  <li>Makes sure that new releases are available</li>
  <li>Jumps in and solves problems noone else is interested in</li>
  <li>If a member of JEDI Steering, tries to promote and speek for the project </li>
  <li>Communicates with the team members in private if needed (or wanted), trying to keep the team happy and content</li>
  <li>Tries to help solve issues between developers within the team as well as issues with people outside the team</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">Promotes the project whenever and however he can</li>
</ul>

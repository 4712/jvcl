<p><b>February 2004:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>A beta release of JVCL 3 has been posted to 
  sourceforge on february 20 (<a href="Downloads.htm">download</a>). Since this 
  is a beta, it is very possible that it contains bugs, so please help us make 
  the JVCL better by reporting any findings to our <a href="ReportBug.htm">
  bugtracker</a>. </li>
  <li>The web site has been redesigned to provide a clearer, more logical and 
  faster loading experience. The pages are not 100% complete, so if you find any 
  issues, <a href="Contact.htm">let us know</a>.</li>

<p><b>January 2004:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>DockPresident components developed by Lu 
  Xioban have been added to the JVCL. DockPresident (renamed to JVCL Docking), 
  is a fabulous library of docking components that allows developer to add 
  docking support to their applications with virtually no code. There are 
  several docking styles supported: Standard Delphi, Visual C++, Visual InterDev 
  and the autohiding docking forms of Visual Studio.Net. New docking styles can 
  relatively easy be added by deriving new docking components from the base 
  classes.</li>
  <li>The Delphi eXperience II and Delphi eXperience DotNet components developed by Marc Hoffman now have been added to 
  the JVCL.&nbsp;Delphi eXperience II (renamed to Jv XP Controls) is a set of visual 
  components that have a distinct XP/Office XP and include standard controls, 
  like buttons and checkboxes as well as a very nice XP style navigation bar 
  component. Delphi eXperience DotNet (renamed to Jv DotNet Controls) is a set 
  of standard controls with a visual look similar to the hot tracking style of 
  the VS.Net components. This package includes standard as well as DB enabled 
  controls.</li>

<h2>Developer Help</h2>
<hr>
<p>Becoming a developer in JVCL (or any open source project, for that matter) can be overwhelming at the beginning. Not only are you&nbsp; 
unaquainted with the source code but you also have no clue to how the wor is divided, where to ask for help or what you can and cannot do.
</p>
<p>This document aims to provide you with answers to most of the questions you might have about JVCL and what you can do to improve it and 
at the same time personally benefit from the work you put in.</p>

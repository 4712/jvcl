<h2>Developer Help</h2>
<hr>
<p>Becoming a developer in JVCL (or any open source project, for that matter) can be overwhelming at the beginning. Not only are you&nbsp; 
unaquainted with the source code but you also have no clue to how the work is divided, where to ask for help or what you can and cannot do.
</p>
<p>This document aims to provide you with answers to most of the questions you might have about JVCL and what you can do to improve it and 
at the same time personally benefit from the work you put in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Who will be invited to become a JVCL developer?</h4>
<p>The only reason to make someone a JVCL developer is to grant them write access to CVS. This means that although you might have provided a 
lot of help in enhancing the JVCL it is entirely possible that if you don't need CVS access, you will still not be granted developer status.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here's some of the most common criteria we use to determine whether someone will be made a developer or not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Has donated a library of components that has been accepted and has agreed on helping maintain it.</li>
  <li>Has provided substantial help with enhancing the JVCL, either as a bug fixer, donator or in any other way that makes it obvious that 
  the person needs CVS access</li>
  <li>Knows the JVCL coding style and follows it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, developers will be invited by one of the admins to become a developer but if you feel that you should have CVS access, 
you can contact an admin and ask if you can be added to the team. Even if the admin turns you down, that doesn't have to mean that you have 
done anything wrong or haven't been as active as required. Most of the time it is just a matter of determining whether you actually need CVS 
access or not.</p>
<p>Note that even if you are not a developer, you can still provide bug fixes and enhancements through the bug tracker or the newgroups.</p>
<h4>Who will not become a JVCL developer?</h4>
<p>People who have contributed nothing or little to the JVCL, who doesn't really need CVS access, who has a sloppy coding style, who 
constantly submit buggy and non-working code or have a known history of malicious behavior towards JVCL or other projects will have little 
chance of becoming a JVCL developer.</p>
<h4>What happens when I become a developer?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">First, you are added to the team on the SF page by an admin who also sets up your permissions. You should then have write 
access to CVS (se the CVS page on how to set up CVS with SSH). The admin also adds you to the various project trackers, so you get mail when 
something happens. You will also be added as developer to the bug tracker which means you can modify and take over bug issues.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">What do I have to do as a developer?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Once you are a developer, there is really nothing you <i>have </i>to do. JVCL development is based on voluntary work so we 
don't require anyone to do anything but since you have access, doing something might be a good idea&lt;g&gt;. You might even have a task if you've 
donated a library and agreed on maintaining it. The best way to find out what is going on and what needs to be done is to monitor the 
newsgroups, the task tracker on the SF page as well as the bug tracker. </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you're new to JVCL, one of the best ways of getting aquainted is to try to fix some of the bugs reported in Mantis and 
expand from there. If you still have nothing to do, posting a message to the newsgroup letting everyone know that you are available for JVCL 
work, usually triggers at least a couple of replies with suggestions.</p>
<h4>What should I avoid doing?</h4>
<p>There are some things you should avoid in JVCL:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't change code without knowing it or without testing it.</li>
  <li>Don't introduce version specific changes (example: TStringlist.CaseSense is not available in D5 or D6).</li>
  <li>Don't delete files without asking an admin or in the nesgroups first.</li>
  <li>Don't name units, classes and types in a way that conflicts with the JVCL standard.</li>
  <li>Don't create new CVS folders or files without prior permission.</li>
  <li>If you have access to several versions of Delphi/BCB/Kylix, test your code with all versions before committing it. </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">If you are unsure if a particular code change will work with other versions of Delphi, try to find another developer willing to 
test it before committing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Note that if you've been inactive for some time (at least several weeks), you might get removed without prior notice. </p>

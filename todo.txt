TODO for JVCL 3.0
======================
- JvArrowButton.pas move GrayedBitmap function to JCL and file to Archive
- JvaScrollText change crude Delay function
- JvAVICapture.pas has some strange boolean expressions which should be fixed

- JvAirBrush.pas has a timing mechanism for spray which has to be reanimated or deleted // (rom)
- JvAniFile.pas implement write of animated icon // (rom)
- JvAnimatedImage.pas TJvImageControl.DoPaintControl is not yet CLX compatible // (rom)
- JvAnimateTitle.pas TJvAnimTitle.AnimateTitle implementation of blinking title is problematic. // (rom)
  Better try to manipulate the WM_GETTEXT and WM_SETTEXT to the Form window.
- JvAppHotKey.pas better catch WM_HOTKEY with Application.HookMainWindow?

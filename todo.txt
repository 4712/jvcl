TODO for JVCL 3.0
======================
- JvAirBrush.pas has a timing mechanism for spray which has to be reanimated or deleted // (rom)
- JvAniFile.pas implement write of animated icon // (rom)
- JvAnimatedImage.pas TJvImageControl.DoPaintControl is not yet CLX compatible // (rom)
- JvAnimateTitle.pas TJvAnimTitle.AnimateTitle implementation of blinking title is problematic. // (rom)
  Better try to manipulate the WM_GETTEXT and WM_SETTEXT to the Form window.
- JvAppHotKey.pas better catch WM_HOTKEY with Application.HookMainWindow?
